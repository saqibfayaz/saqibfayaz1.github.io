## Projects
### Analysis of Y Combinator-Funded Startups
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/Ycombinators.ipynb)

Analyzed and visualized factors associated with the success and failure of 4,845 Y Combinator-funded startups using **Python** libraries (**Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, **Seaborn**). Merged datasets on companies, industries, regions, and founder education to create a comprehensive dataset, transforming categorical data into numerical representations with cat.codes to identify correlations. Explored success factors such as industry, region, and team size, defining success as startups with 100+ employees and active status. Visualized findings with stacked bar charts, tree maps, and sunburst plots to compare trends between successful and failed startups, uncovering regional and sector-specific insights into startup outcomes.

### Analysis of Bitly User Data for USA.gov
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/Bitly%20Data%20from%20USA.gov%20project.ipynb)

Analyzed and visualized user data on government-related URLs shortened via Bitly, using Python libraries (**Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib**) to extract and process JSON data. Identified top time zones and usage patterns, categorized users by OS type (Windows vs. non-Windows), and grouped data by time zone and OS for detailed insights. Normalized and visualized data to highlight regional and platform-specific trends in service activity.
