## Projects
### Telco Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Strategies
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/Telco_Customer_Data_Subscription_based.ipynb)

In this project, I analyzed **customer churn data** to identify factors **influencing customer retention**. I used Python along with libraries like **Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation**, **Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization**, and **SciPy for statistical testing**. The analysis involved exploring relationships between customer attributes such as gender, online security, and churn status. Although a **chi-square test** showed no significant association between gender and churn, **further analysis revealed** that customers without online security were more likely to churn, with **20%** of women and **21%** of men **unsubscribing**. This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and statistical methods can provide actionable insights for addressing business challenges like customer churn.

### Analysis of Y Combinator-Funded Startups
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/Ycombinators.ipynb)

Analyzed and visualized factors associated with the success and failure of 4,845 Y Combinator-funded startups using **Python** libraries (**Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, **Seaborn**). Merged datasets on companies, industries, regions, and founder education to create a comprehensive dataset, transforming categorical data into numerical representations with cat.codes to identify correlations. Explored success factors such as industry, region, and team size, defining success as startups with 100+ employees and active status. Visualized findings with stacked bar charts, tree maps, and sunburst plots to compare trends between successful and failed startups, uncovering regional and sector-specific insights into startup outcomes.

### Analysis of Bitly User Data for USA.gov
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/Bitly%20Data%20from%20USA.gov%20project.ipynb)

Analyzed and visualized user data on government-related URLs shortened via Bitly, using Python libraries (**Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib**) to extract and process JSON data. Identified top time zones and usage patterns, categorized users by OS type (Windows vs. non-Windows), and grouped data by time zone and OS for detailed insights. Normalized and visualized data to highlight regional and platform-specific trends in service activity.

### Fandango Score Comparison
[Github](https://github.com/saqibfayaz/Analytics_Projects/blob/main/movies_fandango_revisited.ipynb)

Analyzed movie ratings across multiple platforms to identify discrepancies and correlations, focusing on Fandango and Metacritic ratings. Applied statistical methods to calculate central tendencies and performed regression analysis using SciPy’s stats module, evaluating model accuracy with R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error. Visualized linear regression results and detected outliers, showcasing expertise in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and regression modeling.
